1) Find the right icon for your language, it must be declined in two versions, normal and a version where the opacity is 50%.
    - The size of the icon must be 75 x 75
    - https://www.flaticon.com/packs/flags-3  (link to get your flag)

2) You have to create a json file which will include these few lines...

{
    "translation_id": "english", 
    "language": "English",
    "icon": "tl/english/english_idle.png",
    "icon-hover":"tl/english/english_hover.png"
  }

3) The default language it's in French (sorry) 
you will have to use the English translation to translate in your language,
it will not make it easier for you and I apologize.


4) Here's an example

# game/scripts/story/ancient district/dojo/dojo_exterior.rpy:58
translate german dojo_exterior_dd982f53:

    # player "Rien qu'à l'entrée, on est déjà bien dans l'ambiance." id dojo_exterior_dd982f53
    player "" id dojo_exterior_dd982f53

You just have to put between "" your translation

At some point there will be strange characters such as \n 
they are necessary and allow a line break, they are mostly used for the clues on the side

5) OPTIONNAL
The default font used in the game may not be suitable for all languages. In this case you have to create a .rpy file which will contain these two lines

translate mylanguage style default:
    font "tl/mylanguage/suitablefont.ttf"
    


Once you are done, you just have to copy and paste your file in the game's tl folder and choose your language in the game.
I hope I have been clear enough, if you have any questions ask them in the translation channel of the discord.
Thanks to you
